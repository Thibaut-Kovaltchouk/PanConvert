## Installation

Running the program you must have installed the following additional software-packages:

- pandoc
- python3
- QT5
- pyqt5

Not working is python2, QT4 and pyqt4. There can be some issues with older versions of QT5 and pyqt5. QT5.3.0 is
initially used.


On Linux most actual distributions come preinstalled with the first 3 packages. Package-Managers allow to install pandoc.

On Windows you have to manually install all the packages by hand. See all the links below.

On MacOS homebrew can be used to install python3, QT5 and pyqt5. Pandoc has to be downloaded from the pandoc-homepage.
