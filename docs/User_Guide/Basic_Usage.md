## Usage of the manual converter 

The Standard â€“ Checkbox has to be unchecked.

In the from field you have to fill in the supported pandoc formats of
the source format.

In the to field you have to fill in the supported pandoc formats of the
destination format

In the Parameter field, all known pandoc parameters, separated via semicolon ';' can be used.

For some formats the Parameter field can be left blank, for others it
has to be filled. 

To get a odt or epub file, you have to specify the name of the file. There is a working
example for odt filled in already. The file will be saved in the same directory where the panconvert directory is saved, e.g. on MacOS it will be /Applications
